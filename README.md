I'm Awa Afo, a tech enthusiast with a strong focus on cybersecurity. Currently studying Computer Informational Systems (CIS) at CUNY Lehman College, I'm deeply passionate about using technology to create a safer digital world. 


## Objective
My journey into cybersecurity has been exciting and fulfilling, driven by curiosity and a desire to protect digital assets.

As part of an Innovation Fellowship in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House, I'm diving into penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence. This hands-on experience has broadened my technical skills and sharpened my problem-solving abilities.

Outside of academics, I've participated in leadership programs like the Malave Leaders Program, where I've developed project management skills and collaborated on real-world cybersecurity challenges. My dedication to cybersecurity excellence motivates me to stay ahead of emerging threats and technologies.

**What is cloud computing 
Cloud computing is the process of accessing and using computing services through the internet. It eliminates the need for local infrastructure or hardware by allowing users to utilize servers, storage, databases, and software applications on demand.

On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision and manage computing resources without human interaction with service providers.
Broad Network Access: Services are accessible over the internet via various devices.
Resource Pooling: Resources are shared and dynamically allocated to multiple users.
Rapid Elasticity: Resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.
Measured Service: Usage of resources is monitored, controlled, and billed based on the consumption.

**Benefits of Cloud Computing
**
Scalability: Cloud computing allows businesses to easily scale their resources up or down based on their needs. This flexibility ensures that businesses can quickly adapt to changes in demand without the need for significant upfront investments.
Cost Savings: Cloud computing eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure. Instead, businesses can pay for the resources they use on a pay-as-you-go basis, reducing overall costs.
Flexibility: Cloud computing provides businesses with the flexibility to access their data and applications from anywhere, at any time, using any device with an internet connection. This enables remote work and increases productivity.
Reliability: Cloud service providers offer high levels of reliability and uptime, ensuring that businesses can access their data and applications whenever they need them.
Security: Cloud service providers employ advanced security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, ensuring that businesses can store their data securely in the cloud.

**Common Cloud Computing Services
**
Cloud computing offers a variety of services that can be utilized by businesses and individuals. The three most common types of cloud computing services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each service provides different levels of functionality and flexibility to meet the diverse needs of users.

**Types of Cloud Computing
**

Public Cloud
Services are provided over the internet to multiple users.
Cost-effective and scalable solution for small to medium-sized businesses.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

Private Cloud
Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
Offers enhanced security and control over data.
Examples: VMware, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure Stack.

Hybrid Cloud
Combination of public and private clouds.
Allows organizations to take advantage of both scalability and security.
Examples: IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Dell EMC.
