## HELLO!!! WELCOME

I'm Awa Afo, a tech enthusiast with a strong focus on cybersecurity. Currently studying Computer Informational Systems (CIS) at CUNY Lehman College, I'm deeply passionate about using technology to create a safer digital world. My journey into cybersecurity has been exciting and fulfilling, driven by curiosity and a desire to protect digital assets.

As part of an Innovation Fellowship in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House, I'm diving into penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence. This hands-on experience has broadened my technical skills and sharpened my problem-solving abilities.

Outside of academics, I've participated in leadership programs like the Malave Leaders Program, where I've developed project management skills and collaborated on real-world cybersecurity challenges. My dedication to cybersecurity excellence motivates me to stay ahead of emerging threats and technologies.
