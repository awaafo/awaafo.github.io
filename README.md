It is vital to ensure the security of an organization, as it influences various aspects of a business’s integrity and reputation. Security is essential and thankfully, cybersecurity professionals foster that sense of safety on a daily basis by ensuring a smooth operation. Cyber professionals work to prevent unauthorized attacks, maintain privacy, security and stability, and are continuously developing innovative solutions to guarantee the privacy of people, organizations and businesses. Our Cybersecurity Training Lab simulated a real-world scenario, allowing us to practice cybersecurity skills in situations that mimic those encountered in actual organizations. Creating a virtual environment gave us hands-on practice, where we gained practical experience in various cybersecurity concepts. We were able to better understand how to implement security policies, use security tools, and showcase our skills and new found knowledge working with Amazon Web Services (AWS). We will discuss working with AWS and  how its services achieve the functionalities typically provided by Security Information and Event Management (SIEM),  Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/ Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), firewall, and monitoring tools in a traditional cybersecurity environment. 

In our lab, we created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and connected our private and public subnets to it. Isolation was key for this project due to potential security breaches or malware outbreaks within the lab environment.  Now, to achieve this isolation within the VPC, we leveraged security groups.  During our lab, we created four security groups. Security groups act as a firewall to your instances by filtering both inbound and outbound traffic. The only traffic that reaches the instance is the traffic allowed by the security group. When instances are launched within a VPC, you can assign multiple security groups to it. When creating a security group, you provide it with a name and a description. 

A VPC is a personal isolated segment within the AWS cloud. VPC’s enable users to set up security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to regulate communication between various components within the cloud environment, providing a layer of protection against unauthorized access and malicious activities. This allows the environment to be controlled, providing a level of privacy and security similar to that of a traditional on-premises data center.

VPCs are highly configurable and allow for granular control. This means users can set up private subnets for sensitive workloads, public subnets for applications that need internet access, and control traffic flow between different parts of their infrastructure using network ACLs and security groups.  Having a VPC in our lab provided us with this very benefit: a segregated environment where our cybersecurity experiment could be conducted without affecting other network environments.

Private subnets are essential for protecting sensitive resources in the AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment, such as the Metasploitable2 instance, and for enhancing the infrastructure's overall security posture. Organizations can protect this purposefully vulnerable virtual computer from direct internet exposure by deploying Metasploitable2 inside a private subnet, thereby reducing the danger of unauthorized access or exploitation. By limiting traffic to the Metasploitable2 instance and enabling regulated communication within the AWS network, the private subnet serves as a secure enclave. By decreasing the attack surface and thwarting potential threats from outside networks, this segregation improves security. 

Additionally, administrators can impose stringent access controls and safeguard the Metasploitable2 instance from malicious behavior by implementing extra security measures within the private subnet, such as employing Security Groups and Network ACLs. The use of Metasploitable2 and private subnets in this configuration highlights the significance of strong security procedures in reducing risks and preserving the integrity of the AWS environment.

A public subnet in a cloud environment like Amazon Web Services (AWS) typically hosts resources that need to be publicly accessible, such as web servers or application servers. Functionality similar to a firewall can be achieved by configuring network access control lists (NACLs) or security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from the subnet. Monitoring tools can be utilized to monitor traffic flow and detect any suspicious activity within the public subnet.

An internet gateway is a redundant, and highly available VPC component on AWS that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic, and enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances). An internet gateway connects to the internet if the EC2 instance has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. Additionally, resources on the internet can initiate a connection to resources in your subnet using the public IPv4 address or IPv6 address. As an example, an internet gateway allows you to connect to an EC2 instance in AWS using your host computer. While only one Internet Gateway can be attached to a VPC, AWS allows you to deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. Each AZ is isolated, has its own power, cooling, and networking. This is specifically designed to be independent of failure in other AZs, and it is how redundancy is achieved. 

A route table defines the rules for routing traffic within a VPC or between a VPC and other networks (e.g., the internet or on-premises networks). Route tables play a crucial role in directing network traffic to the appropriate destinations. According to AWS, routers consult their routing tables millions of times each second

A bastion host is a hardened server that is exposed to the public internet and commonly acts as a secure gateway through SSH proxy for accessing resources within a private network or subnet. A bastion host enhances security by providing controlled access to private resources. Access to the bastion host can be tightly controlled using mechanisms such as SSH keys or multi-factor authentication (MFA), reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Ubuntu means "humanity towards others" and is inspired by the Nguni philosophy. It comes from a family of Bantu languages spoken in Southern Africa. Mark Shuttleworth founded Canonical, a company that employs developers, including some from Debian, who created Ubuntu, the Linux desktop we know today. The first version of Ubuntu was released in October 2004 and was known as "Warty Warthog." Since then, there have been many derivatives of Ubuntu. According to Ubuntu’s official website, it is the world’s most widely used Linux workstation platform. Designed for tasks like web browsing, email, and multimedia, Ubuntu is also suitable for cloud computing and servers. Ubuntu is known for its user-friendliness, pre-installed applications, and focus on overall system security. 

Kali Linux has a rich heritage, drawing from earlier projects like Whoppix (WhiteHat Knoppix), WHAX (WhiteHat Slax), and BackTrack. It first emerged in March 2013. Designed specifically for penetration testing and security auditing, Kali Linux caters to security professionals. While user-friendliness isn't its main focus, requiring some Linux knowledge upfront, Kali prioritizes security tools to help identify vulnerabilities in other systems.

Splunk is a big data platform for searching, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data. It can take data from various sources, including Microsoft Windows event logs, web server logs, live application logs, network feeds, metrics, change monitoring, message queues, archive files, and more. Splunk can perform as a SIEM tool by aggregating log data from various sources, correlating events, and generating alerts for potential security incidents.
It provides capabilities for real-time monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and forensic analysis, making it a versatile tool for cybersecurity operations.

PfSense is an open-source firewall and routing software that can be deployed as a perimeter firewall, virtual private network (VPN) router, or Local area network/Wide area network (LAN/WAN) router in various network environments. You can set pfsense up to have optional SSH key access for greater security. Pfsense also offers features such as networking diagnostic tools, hardware monitoring, web based configuration and administration and much more.

In conclusion, we explored the value of cybersecurity training labs and the functionality of various tools within the AWS environment. We discussed the importance of security in organizations and how cybersecurity professionals work to maintain it. The training lab provided hands-on experience in utilizing AWS services like VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, and security groups to create a secure, isolated environment. We learned how these services achieve functionalities similar to traditional security tools like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEM tools. By understanding these components, individuals can gain valuable practical skills for securing cloud-based infrastructure.
