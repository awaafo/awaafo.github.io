 Hi! I'm Awa Afo, an enthusiastic computer information systems student at CUNY Lehman College with a focus on cybersecurity. I'm currently completing a program in cybersecurity at The Knowledge House, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence. This program, combined with my existing project management and community engagement skills, makes me a well-rounded candidate.


## Objective
My journey into cybersecurity has been exciting and fulfilling, driven by curiosity and a desire to protect digital assets.

As part of an Innovation Fellowship in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House, I'm diving into penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence. This hands-on experience has broadened my technical skills and sharpened my problem-solving abilities.

Outside of academics, I've participated in leadership programs like the Malave Leaders Program, where I've developed project management skills and collaborated on real-world cybersecurity challenges. My dedication to cybersecurity excellence motivates me to stay ahead of emerging threats and technologies.
